Frequently Answered Questions
=============================

Q. Pragha does not play certain audio file.
A. Pragha adds new audio formats on a par with taglib.
   If compiled with taglib = 1.4, pragha support ogg, flac, mpeg, wav
   and all variants. If taglib = 1.6 add support to asf, wma and m4a.
   If taglib >= 1.7 also support ape files.
   Then you need to install the gstreamer codecs needed to play them.
   In general installing gstreamer-plugins-bad and gstreamer-plugins-ugly
   you can play all files.

Q. Pragha does not use symbolic icons.
A. It was decided to use generic icons, and leave trhe design problems, to the
   designers!.
   As a developer, I just want to show an icon that when clicked, must start
   the playback. "media-playback-start" sounds good. Do not?. Well, The
   GNOME developers recommend using "media-playback-start-symbolic". Why?.
   because the icon may not look good with dark themes. Ok.. But this is my
   problem? No!. It's from the designers.
   They can make the icons look symbolic where they think convenient. You do not
   believe me? Add the following line to your favorite theme.
   '.header-bar { -gtk-icon-style: symbolic; }'
   or "GtkHeaderBar {-gtk-icon-style: symbolic;}' if you use gtk3 < 3.20.
   In the same way you can force system tray icons symbolics adding this line
   'GtkTrayIcon { -gtk-icon-style: symbolic; }"
   If you only want to change the Pragha icons, you can do it by adding a file
   '~/.config/pragha/custom.css' with this.
